# GeneticAlgorithm_Example
This code is published under name of Convex Optimization course project.

The Convex Optimization 2 course project in Sharif UT were defined for students to present an improvement in optimization, or a non-mentioned method in the course. I decided to present and report a brief overview on Genetic Algorithm, I wrote a report and describe the method, at the end of the report, a real case method results was reported to mention the advantages and disadvantages of the method.

Here in this code, I tried to solve a [Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) using both the accurate brute force search and approximated Genetic Algorithm and compare them in time and accuracy features.
